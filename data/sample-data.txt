19274464	Diffusion and reaction in the cell glycocalyx and the extracellular matrix	Many biologically important macromolecular reactions are assembled and catalyzed at the cell lipid-surface and thus, the extracellular matrix and the glycocalyx layer mediate transfer and exchange of reactants and products between the flowing blood and the catalytic lipid-surface. This paper presents a mathematical model of reaction-diffusion equations that simply describes the transfer process and explores its influence on surface reactivity for a prototypical pathway, the tissue factor (Tf) pathway of blood coagulation. The progressively increasing friction offered by the matrix and glycocalyx to reactants and to the product (coagulation factors X, VIIa and Xa) approaching the reactive surface is simulated and tested by solving the equations numerically with both, monotonically decreasing and constant diffusion profiles. Numerical results show that compared to isotropic transfer media, the anisotropic structure of the matrix and glycocalyx sharply decreases overall reaction rates and significantly increases the mean transit time of reactants; this implies that the anisotropy modifies the distribution of reactants. Results also show that the diffusional transfer, whether isotropic or anisotropic, influences reaction rates according to the order at which the reactants arrive at the boundary. Faster rates are observed when at least one of the reactants is homogeneously distributed before the other arrives at the boundary than when both reactants transfer simultaneously from the boundary.
19375691	Understanding customers' holistic perception of switches in automotive human-machine interfaces	For successful new product development, it is necessary to understand the customers' holistic experience of the product beyond traditional task completion, and acceptance measures. This paper describes research in which ninety-eight UK owners of luxury saloons assessed the feel of push-switches in five luxury saloon cars both in context (in-car) and out of context (on a bench). A combination of hedonic data (i.e. a measure of 'liking'), qualitative data and semantic differential data was collected. It was found that customers are clearly able to differentiate between switches based on the degree of liking for the samples' perceived haptic qualities, and that the assessment environment had a statistically significant effect, but that it was not universal. A factor analysis has shown that perceived characteristics of switch haptics can be explained by three independent factors defined as 'Image', 'Build Quality', and 'Clickiness'. Preliminary steps have also been taken towards identifying whether existing theoretical frameworks for user experience may be applicable to automotive human-machine interfaces.
19401818	Plant vaccines: An immunological perspective	The advent of technologies to express heterologous proteins in planta has led to the proposition that plants may be engineered to be safe, inexpensive vehicles for the production of vaccines and possibly even vectors for their delivery. The immunogenicity of a variety of antigens of relevance to vaccination expressed in different plants has been assessed. The purpose of this article is to examine the utility of plant-expression systems in vaccine development from an immunological perspective.
19401819	Display of peptides on the surface of tobacco mosaic virus particles	In this review, we focus on the potential that tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has as a carrier for immunogenic epitopes, and the factors that must be considered in order to bring products based on this platform to the market. Large Scale Biology Corporation developed facile and scaleable methods for manufacture of candidate peptide display vaccines based on TMV. We describe how rational design of peptide vaccines can improve the manufacturability of particular TMV products. We also discuss downstream processing and purification of the vaccine products, with particular attention to the metrics that a product must attain in order to meet criteria for regulatory approval as injectable biologics.
19401820	Chloroplast-derived vaccine antigens and biopharmaceuticals: Expression, folding, assembly and functionality	Chloroplast genetic engineering offers several advantages, including high levels of transgene expression, transgene containment via maternal inheritance, and multi-gene expression in a single transformation event. Oral delivery is facilitated by hyperexpression of vaccine antigens against cholera, tetanus, anthrax, plague, or canine parvovirus (4%-31% of total soluble protein, TSP) in transgenic chloroplasts (leaves) or non-green plastids (carrots, tomato) as well as the availability of antibiotic free selectable markers or the ability to excise selectable marker genes. Hyperexpression of several therapeutic proteins, including human serum albumin (11.1% TSP), somatotropin (7% TSP), interferon-alpha (19% TSP), interferon-gamma (6% TSP), and antimicrobial peptide (21.5% TSP), facilitates efficient and economic purification. Also, the presence of chap-erones and enzymes in chloroplasts facilitates assembly of complex multisubunit proteins and correct folding of human blood proteins with proper disulfide bonds. Functionality of chloroplast-derived vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated by several assays, including the macrophage lysis assay, GM1-ganglioside binding assay, protection of HeLA cells or human lung carcinoma cells against encephalomyocarditis virus, systemic immune response, protection against pathogen challenge, and growth or inhibition of cell cultures. Purification of human proinsulin has been achieved using novel purification strategies (inverse temperature transition property) that do not require expensive column chromatography techniques. Thus, transgenic chloroplasts are ideal bio-reactors for production of functional human and animal therapeutic proteins in an environmentally friendly manner.
19401821	Production of antibodies in plants: Approaches and perspectives	Advances in molecular biology, immunology, and plant biotechnology have changed the paradigm of plant as a food source to so-called plant bioreactor to produce valuable recombinant proteins. These include therapeutic or diagnostic monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and other biopharmaceutical proteins. The plant as a bioreactor for the production of therapeutic proteins has several advantages, which include the lack of animal pathogenic contaminants, low cost of production, and ease of agricultural scale-up compared to other currently available systems. Thus, plants are considered to be a potential alternative to compete with other systems such as bacteria, yeast, or insect and mammalian cell culture. Plant production systems, particularly therapeutic antibodies, are very attractive to pharmaceutical companies to produce the antibodies in demand. Currently, we have successfully developed a plant system for production of anti-rabies monoclonal antibody and anti-colorectal cancer monoclonal antibody. The effective plant production system for recombinant antibodies requires the appropriate plant expression machinery with optimal combination of transgene expression regulatory elements, control of posttranslational protein processing, and efficient purification methods for product recovery. However, there are several limitations that have to be resolved to establish the efficient plant system for antibody production. Here, we discuss the approaches and perspectives in plant systems to produce monoclonal antibody.
19401822	Plant production of veterinary vaccines and therapeutics	Plant-derived biologicals for use in animal health are becoming an increasingly important target for research into alternative, improved methods for disease control. Although there are no commercial products on the market yet, the development and testing of oral, plant-based vaccines is now beyond the proof-of-principle stage. Vaccines, such as those developed for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, have the potential to stimulate both mucosal and systemic, as well as, lactogenic immunity as has already been seen in target animal trials. Plants are a promising production system, but they must compete with existing vaccines and protein production platforms. In addition, regulatory hurdles will need to be overcome, and industry and public acceptance of the technology are important in establishing successful products.
19401823	Plant-based oral vaccines: Results of human trials	Vaccines consisting of transgenic plant-derived antigens offer a new strategy for development of safe, inexpensive vaccines. The vaccine antigens can be eaten with the edible part of the plant or purified from plant material. In phase 1 clinical studies of prototype potato- and corn-based vaccines, these vaccines have been safe and immunogenic without the need for a buffer or vehicle other than the plant cell. Transgenic plant technology is attractive for vaccine development because these vaccines are needle-less, stable, and easy to administer. This chapter examines some early human studies of oral transgenic plant-derived vaccines against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection, norovirus, and hepatitis B.
19423075	Evaluation of a 3 year intervention to increase adoption of safer nursery crop production practices	Background: We conducted a 3 year intervention to increase awareness and adoption of eight more profitable nursery crop production practices that reduced certain traumatic and musculoskeletal injury hazards. Methods: We disseminated information to nursery managers across seven states using information channels they were known to rely on (e.g. trade publications, public events, university Extension, other managers). We evaluated rolling, independent, probability samples (n = 1200) with mail questionnaires before the intervention and after each of 3 intervention years. We also evaluated samples (n = 250) from a comparison group of New Zealand nursery managers. Results: The intervention was associated with increased awareness of four of the eight practices among US managers after year 3 compared to their baseline: zippers (20 vs. 32%, p€ 0.000), stools (11 vs. 22%, p€ 0.001), pruners (29 vs. 40%, p€ 0.014), and tarps (24 vs. 33%, p€ 0.009). There were no changes in adoption. New Zealand manager awareness was increased for hoes after year 2 compared to their baseline (35 vs. 52%, p€ 0.010). Conclusions: A modest, regionwide information dissemination intervention was associated with increased awareness, but not adoption.
19426963	Evaluation of four cursor control devices during a target acquisition task for laparoscopic tool control	Current laparoscopic surgery instruments create awkward postures which produce fatigue and pressure points in surgeons. In order to alleviate some of this discomfort a new laparoscopic tool had been developed with the inclusion of an articulating end-effector manipulated by a trackball. The current study was developed to access the performance of four input devices which could replace the manual trackball in a powered laparoscopic tool. A simple Fitts' law task was conducted and the devices' performance was evaluated with both subjective and objective measures. This article makes three main contributions to the scientific community. First, it provides a comparison of four control devices (TouchPad, Mouse Button Module, MiniJoystick Module and MicroJoystick) for use in a powered laparoscopic tool. Second, it provides an understanding of how the non-traditional measure of target re-entry can be utilized to compare control devices and how this relates to the more traditional measures of throughput and error rate. Finally, it contributes to the understanding of how a user's familiarity with a control device could affect the subjective and objective performance of the device. The main results indicate that the TouchPad and MicroJoystick are the best candidate-devices for use in a powered laparoscopic tool. The article also provides support for utilizing the new measure target re-entry when comparing control performance. Although studied in the application of laparoscopic surgery, the results can be generalized for the design of any hand-held device in which the speed and accuracy of the control device is critical.
19447381	Organisational factors and scheduling in locomotive engineers and conductors: Effects on fatigue, health and social well-being	This study examines critical organisational factors and work scheduling in railway freight operators to understand how job-related factors are related to fatigue, health and social well-being. A 148-item questionnaire was developed and distributed to a sample of 276 locomotive engineers and conductors working for the U.S. Operations of a North American Railway. One hundred and twenty-five questionnaires were returned, which was a response rate of 45.3%. Structural equation modeling was performed to identify the relationships between the examined factors. The analytical results of this study indicate that organisational factors and the scheduling system could not be distinguished as two separate factors. The scheduling system is not just the practice of assigning locomotive crewmen to trains, but it is a function tightly connected with other organisational factors. Social Well-Being is an important mediator between Scheduling and Fatigue. Finally, the study revealed a strong relationship between fatigue and health complaints.
19451014	Effectiveness of ultrasound for the destruction of Mycobacterium sp. strain (6PY1)	Ultrasound is widely used to disinfect drinking water and wastewater due to its strong physical and chemical effects on microorganisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrasound on the destruction of Mycobacterium strain 6PY1. Ultrasound waves (20 kHz or 612 kHz) were used to treat aqueous suspensions of Mycobacterium at different volumes, initial bacterial concentrations, and power densities. At the same power density and the same exposure time, sonication at high frequency resulted in a lower destruction of Mycobacterium sp. 6PY1 (35.5%) than sonication at low frequency (93%). The percentage of removal was not significantly affected by the volume of the irradiated suspension (150-300 ml) or the initial cell concentration (2.15 Ã 10-3-1.4 Ã 10-2 mg protein L-1). At low frequency, the removal percentage of Mycobacterium sp. 6PY1 increased with increasing the power density, with a constant level reached after a certain power density. At high frequency, the removal percentage of Mycobacterium sp. 6PY1 increased with increasing the power density. The mechanism of cell killing was investigated by examining the effects of OH{radical dot} radical scavengers such as sodium carbonate. At high frequency the presence of sodium carbonate suppressed the removal process. However, at low frequency the removal process was not affected, thus indicating that OH{radical dot} radicals have a negligible role in this case. The latter result was supported by ten time's H2O2 production at high frequency greater than that at low frequency.
19464939	Ultrasound stimulus effect on hydrogen bonding in networked alumina and polyacrylic acid slurry	The influence of ultrasound (US) on the viscosity of aqueous slurry composing polyacrylic acid (PAA) and alumina was studied. For exposure to an aqueous slurry solution, US waves emitted at three different frequencies of 28, 45, and 100 kHz were used. Results show that the stimulus effect of US on viscosity change was a breakage of the hydrogen bonding networks of alumina and PAA in the slurry solution. That decrease in viscosity was enhanced strongly by US exposure as the output power was increased from 175 to 300 W. In addition, a lower US frequency was effective for slurry viscosity reduction. The reduced viscosity of the slurry also depended on the solution pH. After US was stopped, the viscosity increased gradually and recovered to its original value within about 15 min. The stimulus effect on the viscosity change was cycled by US.
19464940	Direct observation of cavitation fields at 23 and 515 kHz	Direct observation of cavitation fields using photography, sonoluminescence and luminol "mapping" is reported for a 23 kHz horn sonicator and a 515 kHz plate transducer system. The effect of sound intensity and added surfactant on the cavitation fields is described. The observations support previously reported results suggesting significant differences in the cavitation fields between the two sonication systems.
19467908	Synthesis of glycoluril catalyzed by potassium hydroxide under ultrasound irradiation	Synthesis of the glycolurils catalyzed by potassium hydroxide was carried out in 17-75% yield at 40°C in EtOH under ultrasound irradiation. Compared to the method using stirring, the main advantage of the present procedure is milder conditions and shorter reaction time.
